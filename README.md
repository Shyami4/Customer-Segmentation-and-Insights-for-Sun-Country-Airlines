# Customer-Segmentation-and-Insights-for-Sun-Country-Airlines

## Overview
This repository contains the project deliverables for analyzing and segmenting customers of Sun Country Airlines. Using clustering techniques, we derived actionable insights to assist the airline in enhancing its marketing strategies and improving customer engagement.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to segment customers based on their travel behavior, demographic traits, and booking patterns. These insights aim to help Sun Country Airlines:
- Tailor marketing campaigns to different customer groups.
- Improve the overall customer experience.
- Drive business growth by addressing specific needs of each customer segment.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Pre-cleaned dataset including variables such as booking channel, class, amount paid, age, destination, origin, and season of travel.
- **Clustering**: K-Means clustering technique was applied to group customers into five distinct clusters.
- **Visualization**: Insights were visualized using Python's `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries, featuring bar charts, box plots, and pie charts.
- **Recommendations**: Actionable strategies for targeting specific clusters and optimizing marketing efforts.

## Clustering Insights
The analysis resulted in five key customer segments:
1. **Older Travelers within Minnesota**: Primarily use UFly membership for local travel.
2. **Out-of-State Young Last-Minute Bookers**: Tend to book closer to the travel date and spend less.
3. **Group Travelers Using External Booking Channels**: Often travel in large groups.
4. **Single-Flight Out-of-State Customers**: Predominantly non-members.
5. **Frequent Older Travelers**: Loyal to Sun Country Airlines and make advance bookings.

## Recommendations
- **Targeted Campaigns**: Customized advertisements based on cluster demographics and preferences.
- **Membership Drives**: Encourage enrollment in the UFly program, especially targeting clusters with lower membership rates.
- **Seasonal Promotions**: Leverage seasonal booking trends to design timely offers.
- **Enhanced Group Offers**: Introduce bulk discounts for clusters with a history of group bookings.
